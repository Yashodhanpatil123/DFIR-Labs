## ðŸ§© Lab: xmlrat (Network Forensics)

**Category:** Network Forensics

**Tactics:** Execution, Defense Evasion  

**Tools:** Wireshark, tshark, CyberChef, VirusTotal, Python3, PowerShell  

**Difficulty:** easy

### ðŸ“˜ Summary

Analyze network traffic to identify malware delivery, deobfuscate scripts, and map attacker techniques using MITRE ATT&CK, focusing on stealthy execution and reflective code loading.

## I wont be giving answers as it will be unfair just some screenshots for hints

### Questions:

- 1 The attacker successfully executed a command to download the first stage of the malware. What is the URL from which the first malware stage was installed?

- 2 Which hosting provider owns the associated IP address?
 
  we just need to scan ip address to whois

- 3 By analyzing the malicious scripts, two payloads were identified: a loader and a secondary executable. What is the SHA256 of the malware executable?
- 
- 1. Export the FILE.jpg
- 2. Open the FILE.jpg, Copy the hexadecimal headers (loaders & executables)
- 3. Paste only the loaders in the cyberchef -> From Hex -> save it (download.dat)
- 4. sha256sum download.dat


- 4 What is the malware family label based on Alibaba?
- paste the sha256 hash in virustotal for your ans


- 5 What is the timestamp of the malware's creation?
- paste sha256 hash on virustotal get your ans


- 6  Which LOLBin is leveraged for stealthy process execution in this script? Provide the full path.

- 7 The script is designed to drop several files. List the names of the files dropped by the script.
  
- During the analysis process of FILE.jpg i finded the same file name with different extensions (.vbs, .ps1, .bat)
